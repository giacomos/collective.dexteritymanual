Introduction
============= 

This manual will teach you how to build content types using the Dexterity system.
If you have arrived here without first reading the `FAQ <http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/faq>`_,
we suggest you do so first. In particular, you should learn about how Dexterity relates to 
Archetypes, and understand the current state of Dexterity development.

If you have decided that Dexterity is for you, and you are a programmer and comfortable
working on the filesystem, then this manual is a good place to start.

This manual will cover:

* Some basic design techniques for solving problems with content types in Plone
* Getting a Dexterity development environment set up
* Creating a package to house your types
* Building a custom type based on a schema
* Creating custom views and forms for your type
* Advanced customisation, including workflow and security
* Testing your types
* A quick reference to common fields, widgets and APIs
